The final group project was an analysis of housing prices in Ames, Iowa. This project consisted of answer two analysis questions.
For this project data known as "The Ames Housing" was compiled by Dean De Cock, and was pulled form Https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview.
Analysis Question 1: quantifying and modeling the relationship between living area (sq ft), and the sale price of the home with respect
to the following neighborhoods: NAmes, Edwards, and BrkSide. 
To tackle this problem of interest, a model was built to estimate how the sale price of a home in Ames, Iowa is related to the sq footage of its living area, and if 
its relationship to living size area depends on the neighborhood in which it is located.
This problem was solved using a multiple linear regression model. To ensure that the data was a good fit for this type of model, the following assumptions were checked:
Linearity, constant Variance, Normality, Independence, and Cook's D and Leverage.
Once assumptions were checked, then building and fiting the model to the data was done through logarithmic transformation of both the response and explanatory variables, 
and model metrics such as R-squared, and the internal CV Press.

Analysis Question 2:Building the most predictive model for the sale prices of all the homes in all the neighborhoods of Ames, Iowa.
To tackle this problem of interest, forward, stepwise, and backward elimination on the training set was used.
First, assumptions were checked. Then, for each selection method, to determine which model was the best, metrics such as the adj R-squared and CV PRESS were evaluated.
