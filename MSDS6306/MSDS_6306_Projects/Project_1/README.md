# Beer_Study
For this project titled "Beer Study", two datasets titled "Beers.cvs" and "Breweries.csv" were given for anlysis.
The Beers.csv file consited of information such as the name of the beer, the ID of the Beer, the ABV, IBU, Brewery ID, the style of the beer, and the ounces of the beer.
The Breweries.csv file consisted of a Brew_ID, the name of the brewery, the city of the brewery, and the state of the brewery.
For this analysis, the following questions were to be answered:
1.	How many breweries are present in each state?

2.	Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.

3.	Report the number of NA's in each column.

4.	Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

5.	Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

6.	Summary statistics for the ABV variable.

7.	Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.

Following the findings, a 5 minute presentation was given. This was a group project.
